# Cardano Ambassador Workshop - CMAT Session

**Date**: November 8, 2025
**Location**: Berlin
**Facilitators**: Hinson Wong, Felix Weber

## Key Discussion Points

From the Cardano Ambassador workshop discussion:

### Spam Prevention

- Explore the possibility of executing spam prevention in offline manner as long as no security concerns on node by simply excluding from indexing

### Protocol Parameters

- Do we need new protocol parameters? Or can we simply recycle old protocol parameters (e.g., treasury withdrawal one)?
- New guardrails introduced by new governance action (e.g., listing & delisting), and following new protocol parameters if any

### Implementation Pathway

- Technology pathway can be going step-by-step
- In scenario where smart contract approach is easier but ledger change is more desired, it is possible to:
  1. Go version 1 as smart contract approach
  2. Then upgrade to ledger approach later

### Potential Use Cases

- A potential new use case: NCL (Net Change Limit) denominated in CNTs other than ADA, like stablecoins
- Treasury can potentially participate in Cardano DeFi / projects
