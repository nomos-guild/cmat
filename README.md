# Cardano Multi Asset Treasury (CMAT)

A community initiative to enable Cardano's on-chain treasury to hold multiple asset types beyond ADA.

## Overview

Cardano's on-chain treasury currently holds funds in ADA only. This creates challenges for proposers who must budget in a volatile currency while their actual costs are denominated in stable fiat values.

CMAT aims to introduce multi-asset support to the treasury, allowing it to receive, hold, and distribute a wide range of Cardano Native Tokens including stablecoins and other assets.

## Motivation

- **Funding Predictability**: Proposers face exchange rate risk when budgeting in ADA
- **Treasury Sustainability**: Diversification reduces exposure to single-asset volatility
- **Economic Opportunities**: Enables strategic holdings, asset donations, and cross-chain partnerships
